# Ohmmeter (Zabex)
realtime ohm meter - shows value and the related E24 value in half a second (or less)

Maybe you always have a lot of loose resistors lying around after your breadboard experiments, 
because sorting them back into the compartments is annoying and awkward.
Then this thing is for you...

* original project: http://www.zabex.de/site/ohmmeter.html
* modified for using LiIon cell: https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/489461
* this version here is just a PCB to make it easy to build this little helper gadget; it uses a standard 0802 LCD display, which is easily available
